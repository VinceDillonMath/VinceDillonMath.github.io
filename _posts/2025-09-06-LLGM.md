## Group Theory

The lamplighter group is defined as the wreath product $L:=\mathbb Z_2 \wr \mathbb Z$ and has the standard presentation $L=\langle a,t: a^2, (at^na^{-n})^2,\quad n\in \mathbb Z\rangle$. The group has a nice mental image: imagine a lamppost at every integer and a "lamplighter" that can walk between lights and turn them on and off. The generator $a$ is "toggle the light you're at" and the generator $t$ is ``move one to the right''. The first relation says that toggling a light on and then off (or vis versa) returns you to the previous state. The second relation says that turning a light on, moving $n$ to the right, turning that light on, and then going back to where you started is an order two "action". Doing this again clearly just reverses what you already did.

The lamplighter group is very heavily studied. Of particular interest are the growth and cogrowth rate of the group. Let $a_n$ denote the number of non-identity elements one can form as a product of $n$ generators, this is called the growth sequence. The authors in [<span style="color: #ce9178;">PrGu17</span>] computed the cogrowth sequence up to a large cutoff by a polynomial-time algorithm. Similarly, $b_n$ will denote the number of ways one can combine $n$ generators to get the identity, this is called the cogrowth sequence. This second sequence is nice to think about: starting at $0$, how many ways can you make $n$ moves such that you return to the origin and don't leave any lights on? Combinatorially, this is the number of returning walks on the integers such that, if you "lazy step" on any given number, you must do so an even number of times throughout the walk.

## Random Matrix Theory

Let $C_n$ denote the cycle graph on $n$ vertices and $A_n$ its adjacency matrix. Let $D_n$ be a diagonal matrix with entries i.i.d. Rademacher random variables, uniform over $\{-1,1}.$ We want to consider the sequence of random matrices given by $C_n+D_n$. Since the eigenvalues of these random matrices are randomly distributed, we may ask about their distribution. In fact, for many ensembles of random matrices, the distribution of eigenvalues (or empirical spectral distribution) converges to some smooth distribution (the limiting spectral distribution), as the matrix size $n\to \infty$, with high probability [<span style="color: #ce9178;">Tao11</span>].

For the purpose of our discussion, let $A_n\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be a sequence of nice symmetric matrices (think of them as having Gaussian or smooth entries satisfying some independence). The eigenvalues are real and the moments of the limiting distribution can be computed as limits of traces of powers of the matrix in question. Since the entries and eigenvalues are random, we have a distribution of distributions and we can only compute moments in expectation. The expected value of the $k^{th}$ moment of the $n^{th}$ matrix is  
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}\mu_{k,n} = \frac{1}{n} \mathbb{E} \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda^k= \frac{1}{n}\mathbb{E}\mathrm{Tr}(A_n^k).
\end{equation}

This trace can be split as a sum over cyclic products of matrix entries:
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E} \mathrm{Tr}(A_n^k) = \sum_{i_1,i_2,\dots, i_k} \mathbb{E}[a_{i_1i_2}a_{i_2i_3}\dots a_{i_{k-1}i_k}a_{i_ki_1}].
\end{equation}
Let's now return to the case of $A_n= C_n+D_N$ where we can rephrase this trace combinatorially. Since we take expectation, we need to be careful about which terms contribute. If the $i_j$ are distinct, we don't have to worry about the expectation since each of the off-diagonal entries are in the set $\{0,1\}. All we need is that vertex $i_j$ is connected to vertex $i_{j+1}$ for all $j$; these contribute returning paths, with no lazy steps, on the n-cycle.

The Rademacher random variables have odd moments $0$ and all even moments are equal to $1$. If some $i_{j_1}=i_{j_2}$, we need an even number of such occurrences for the expectation to be nonzero, and these expectations multiply the term by $1$. We see a similarity between these traces and the combinatorial problem associated to the lamplighter group, there's just one hangup. Since we're dealing with the cycle, what if paths wrap around somehow? We can rest easy in the limit, since, as $n\to \infty$, the size of the cycle goes to infinity while, in the fixed moment we're computing, the path lengths are constant.

Immediately, we see that there are no odd-length paths so the odd moments are $0$ and we should have a symmetric limiting distribution (at least in expectation). 

## Some Visualizations

Plotting the histogram of eigenvalues for $1000$ samples of $A_{3000}$, we get the following interesting shape.

It's also fun to enumerate all of the paths of a given length. Here are the 87 paths of length 6.

For higher lengths, the number of valid walks increases quite quickly so we can visualize them differently. Here are all of the paths of length $8$ overlaid on a plot

and here are the same paths presented sequentially as an animation.
