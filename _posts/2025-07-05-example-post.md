title: "The Class Field Tower Problem and Golod-Shafarevich Groups"

The purpose of this post is to present a counterexample to the so-called class field tower problem. Interestingly, the solution lies almost entirely within the realm of pure algebra and can be understood with almost no background in algebraic number theory. Nonetheless, the problem remained open for decades despite being a natural question arising from elementary algebraic number theory.

$$
\\begin{CD}
   \mathscr{F}(V) @>\phi(V)> > \mathscr{G}(V) \\\\
    @V{\mathrm{res}^V_U}VV @VV{\mathrm{res}^V_U}V \\\\
   \mathscr{F}(U) @>\phi(U)> > \mathscr{G}(U)
\\end{CD}
$$
