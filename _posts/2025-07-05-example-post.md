The purpose of this post is to present a counterexample to the so-called class field tower problem. Interestingly, the solution lies almost entirely within the realm of pure algebra, and can be understood with almost no background in algebraic number theory. Nonetheless, 

$$
\mathcal{D}_X = \text{the sheaf of differential operators on } X
$$
