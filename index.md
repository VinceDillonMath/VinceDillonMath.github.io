I'm a senior at the [University of Washington](https://math.washington.edu/) studying pure math. Right now I'm most interested in arithmetic geometry and number theory, but I tend to just like all math.

Over the summer of 2025 I participated in the SMALL REU at Williams College, working under Professor Steven J. Miller. This was an amazing experience and I want to thank Professor Miller and all of my collaborators for such a wonderful and productive summer.
