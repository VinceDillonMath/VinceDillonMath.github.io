I'm a senior at the University of Washington studying pure math. I'm interested in number theory, arithmetic geometry, and algebraic geometry.

Over the summer of 2025 I participated in the SMALL REU at Williams College, working under Professor Steven J. Miller. This was an amazing experience and I want to thank my Professor Miller and all of my collaborators for such a wonderful and productive summer. SMALL preprints will be added soon.
